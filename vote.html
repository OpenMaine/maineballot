<h1 class="page__title">How to vote in Maine</h1>
People over 18 who have a fixed principal residence in Maine can vote in state elections.  You must register to vote in the community you live in.
<h2>Registering to vote</h2>
Maine has no deadline for registering in person at your town office or city hall.  You can also register to vote by mail up to 21 days before an election.<br>

<h2>Voting by mail</h2>
Anyone registered to vote in Maine can vote by mail by <a href="https://www.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/AbsenteeBallot/index.pl">requesting an absentee ballot</a>. Ballots will be available about one month prior to the election, and you do not need to provide a reason for the request.
<br><br>
You can also pick up a ballot at your <a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/munic.html"> municipal clerk's office</a> or you can request one by mail (<a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/pdf/absballot1120.pdf">PDF request form</a>, <a href ="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/docs/absballot1120.doc">Word request form</a>) or by calling your town clerk's office.
<br><br>
After you fill out your ballot, you can send it back in the mail (it's recommended to send it in at least 15 days before the election due to USPS delays) or you can take it to your <a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/munic.html"> municipal clerk's office.</a>
