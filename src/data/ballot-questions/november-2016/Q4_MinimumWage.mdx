## Results

This measure passed.

## The gist

This referendum would raise the minimum wage by $1 a year until it gets to $12 in 2020. It will also slowly eliminate the tip credit, which tip earning employers pay to make up the difference between wages plus tips and the minimum wage for minimum wage works.

## Ballot question

"Do you want to raise the minimum hourly wage of $7.50 to $9 in 2017, with annual $1 increases up to $12 in 2020, and annual cost-of-living increases thereafter; and do you want to raise the direct wage for service workers who receive tips from half the minimum wage to $5 in 2017, with annual $1 increases until it reaches the adjusted minimum wage?"[^2]

<YesNoTable yesContent={frontmatter.yes_vote} noContent={frontmatter.no_vote} />

## Tell me more

This bill would raise the minimum wage from $7.50 by $1 per year until it gets to $12 per hour in 2020 and have annual increases to match the cost of living after that. The wage for service workers who receive tips would also increase by $1 per year until it reaches the new minimum wage.

## Follow the money

**Annual Costs (2017 - 2020):** $16,500[^2]
<br />**Note:** The costs don't include the cost to increase state worker wages as part of increasing the minimum wage.

### The money will be used to

- Print and mail posters and publications
- Compliance, education, and outreach

### The money will be coming from

- General Fund appropriation

## Pros

The primary arguments for this referendum are:

- Increasing the minimum wage helps workers make ends meet
- Workers with more money to spend helps the local economy
- Could help those on government assistance get off of assistance
- The gradual increase will make the blow to businesses less drastic than a single, larger increase.[^3]

## Cons

The primary arguments against this referendum are:

- Increases the cost of doing business
- Might discourage businesses from relocating to Maine
- Adjusts with inflation when the Consumer Price Index goes up, but not when it goes down
- The changes to the tip credit could negatively affect the wages of servers who already make more than the new minimum wage.
- A living wage at the current cost of living in Maine would be $15 and this starts at $9 and only goes up to $12.[^3]
